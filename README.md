# simple_game

This is a simple game coded with **pygame**.
The game contains one character obeject that will represent the player, three enemy objects
that will represent the enemies & one prize object representing the prize.

How the game works is that the character object will start at a point on the screen and 
the prize object will be on the opposite side of the screen, the three enemy objects will
approach the character object from different positions on the screen and at different speeds. 
The player can make use of the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character object around.

To **win** the game, the character object must avoide colliding with the enemy objects and collide 
with the prize object. If at any point the character object collides with any one of the enemy objects,
the player **loses** and the game is over.

To get started with the game one would need to have **pygame** operating on their machine.
Once you have **pygame** operating, push the project to your machine and get going.:sparkles:
